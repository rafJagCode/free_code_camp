            The photo was taken by Arthur Sasse, on March 14, 1951, Einstein's
            72nd birthday. In the uncropped photo, we can see Einstein sitting
            in a car, between his wife, Elsa, and Dr. Frank Aydelotte, the head
            of the Institute for Advanced Study.

            <li>
              <strong>1905 - Annus Mirabilis (Miracle Year)</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Published four groundbreaking papers in the "Annalen der
                  Physik" journal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Photoelectric Effect: Proposed that light is quantized,
                  earning him the Nobel Prize in 1921.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Brownian Motion: Provided empirical evidence for the existence
                  of atoms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Special Theory of Relativity: Introduced the famous equation
                  E=mcÂ².
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mass-Energy Equivalence: Demonstrated the interconversion of
                  mass and energy.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Presented the final form of the General Theory of Relativity,
                  explaining gravity as the curvature of spacetime.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Confirmed by the 1919 solar eclipse, which observed the
                  bending of light by gravity.
